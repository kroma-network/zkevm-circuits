//! Bus-Mapping is a crate designed to parse EVM execution traces and manipulate
//! all of the data they provide in order to obtain structured witness inputs
//! for the EVM Proof and the State Proof.
//!
//! ## Introduction
//! At the moment every node on ethereum has to validate every transaction in
//! the ethereum virtual machine. This means that every transaction adds work
//! that everyone needs to do to verify Ethereumâ€™s history. Worse still is that
//! each transaction needs to be verified by every new node. Which means the
//! amount of work a new node needs to do the sync the network is growing
//! constantly. We want to build a proof of validity for the Ethereum blocks to
//! avoid this.
//!
//! This means making a proof of validity for the EVM + state reads / writes +
//! signatures.
//! To simplify we separate our proofs into two components.
//!
//! - State proof: State/memory/stack ops have been performed correctly. This
//! does not check if the correct location has been read/written. We allow our
//! prover to pick any location here and in the EVM proof confirm it is correct.
//!
//! - EVM proof: This checks that the correct opcode is called at the correct
//! time. It checks the validity of these opcodes. It also confirms that for
//! each of these opcodes the state proof performed the correct operation.
//!
//! Only after verifying both proofs are we confident that that Ethereum block
//! is executed correctly.
//!
//! ## Bus Mapping
//! The goal of this crate is to serve as:
//! - A parsing lib for EVM execution traces.
//! - A way to infer some witness data that can only be constructed once we've
//!   analyzed the full exec trace.
//! - An easy interface to collect all of the data to witness into the circuits
//!   and witness it with few function calls.
//!
//! ## Parsing
//! Provided a JSON file or a JSON as a stream of bytes, which contains an
//! execution trace from an EVM, you can parse it and construct an
//! `ExecutionTrace` instance from it. That will automatically fill all of the
//! bus-mapping instances of each
//! [`GethExecStep`](eth_types::GethExecStep).  Then the
//! [`CircuitInputBuilder`](crate::circuit_input_builder::CircuitInputBuilder)
//! will fill in an
//! [`OperationContainer`](crate::operation::container::OperationContainer)
//! with all of the Memory, Stack and Storage ops performed
//! by the provided trace.

//!
//! Once you have the trace built (following the code found above) you can
//! basically:
//! - Get an iterator/vector over the `Stack`, `Memory` or `Storage` operations
//!   ordered on the way the State Proof needs.
//!
//! On that way, we would get something like this for the Memory ops:
//! ```text,ignore
//! | `key`  | `val`         | `rw`    | `gc` | Note                                     |
//! |:------:| ------------- | ------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
//! | `0x40` | `0`           | `Write` |      | Init                                     |
//! | `0x40` | `0x80`        | `Write` | 0    | Assume written at the begining of `code` |
//! | `0x40` | `0x80`        | `Read`  | 4    | `56 MLOAD`                               |
//! |   -    |               |         |      |                                          |
//! | `0x80` | `0`           | `Write` |      | Init                                     |
//! | `0x80` | `0xdeadbeef`  | `Write` | 10   | `63 MSTORE`                              |
//! | `0x80` | `0xdeadbeef`  | `Read`  | 16   | `70 MLOAD`                               |
//! | `0x80` | `0x1d97c6efb` | `Write` | 24   | `73 MSTORE`                              |
//! |   -    |               |         |      |                                          |
//! | `0xa0` | `0`           | `Write` |      | Init                                     |
//! | `0xa0` | `0xcafeb0ba`  | `Write` | 34   | `83 MSTORE`
//! ```
//!
//! Where as you see, we group by `memory_address` and then order by
//! `global_counter`.
//!
//! - Iterate over the `ExecutionTrace` itself over
//! each `ExecutionStep`'s is formed by and check which Stack/Memory&Storage
//! operations are linked to each step. This is also automatically done via the
//! [`Opcode`](crate::evm::opcodes::Opcode) trait defined in this crate.
//!

//! entire ZK-EVM solution.
